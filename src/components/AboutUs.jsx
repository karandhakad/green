            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2024 by Karan Dhakad, Green has come a long way from its beginnings in a small garage. When Jane first started out, her passion for sustainable living drove her to start this business so that Green can offer you eco-friendly and beautiful plant solutions. We now serve customers all over the country and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.</p>

        <p>We hope you enjoy our plants as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
        
        <p>Sincerely,<br/>
        Karan Dhakad, Founder</p>
